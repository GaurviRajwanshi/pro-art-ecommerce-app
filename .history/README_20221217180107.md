# ProArt

This is an interactive SPA, with all the basic and some advanced features of an E-comm App. The idea is to innovate the App such than it serves not only as a shopping platform for the users, but also as a shop website for the sellers. Sellers can directly send a link with all the products they have to sell. This will eliminate the need to have their own E-comm website for the sellers.
